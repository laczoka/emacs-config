# About
My rebooted Emacs config, with beautiful theme and font settings, ideal for Clojure work

# Requirements
You need to have a recent Emacs, version 24.4+ installed on your machine.

# Installation
Just clone the repository, replace your .emacs.d directory with its contents and restart Emacs.
You may also want to backup you old configuration. :)
